			By default, sensitive file with a path including a
			symbolic link will be refused to be loaded. Set this
			environment variable to any value to allow load files
			through symbolic links. Note that making use of this
			variable could expose you to symlink attacks and so it
			should only be used in cases where you are absolutely
			sure this is not a risk.
