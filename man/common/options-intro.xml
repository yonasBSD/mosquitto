	There are three ways to provide options to &commandname;: the
	default config file, a specified config file, or options on
	the command line.
</para>

<refsect2>
	<title>Default Config File</title>
	<para>
		The default config file is located at
		<option>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/&commandname;</option> or
		<option>$HOME/.config/&commandname;</option> on POSIX systems, or
		<option>%USERPROFILE%\&commandname;</option> on Windows.
	</para>

	<para>
		The contents of the config file should consist of
		options, one per line in the format:
		<option>-option <replaceable>value</replaceable></option>. If
		options are also specified on the command line, those
		options will override the same options set in the config
		file. The exceptions to this are the message type options, of which
		only one can be specified. Note also that currently some options
		cannot be negated, e.g. <option>-S</option>. TLS encryption options
		can be negated with the <option>--no-tls</option> option.
	</para>
	<para>
		Config file lines that have a <option>#</option> as the first
		character are treated as comments and not processed any further.
	</para>
	<para>
		It is suggested that config files are primarily used for
		authentication purposes. Use of a config file allows you to
		authenticate without the need to show the username and password
		on the command line.

	<title>Config File</title>
	&from-version21;
	<para>
		A config file can be specified on the command line using
		<option>-o <replaceable>config-file</replaceable></option>.
		If the <option>-o</option> option is used, the default config
		file will not be loaded.
	</para>
	<para>
		The format is the same as for the default config file.
