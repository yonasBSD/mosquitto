# =============================================================================
# User configuration section.
#
# These options control compilation on all systems apart from Windows and Mac
# OS X. Use CMake to compile on Windows and Mac.
#
# Largely, these are options that are designed to make mosquitto run more
# easily in restrictive environments by removing features.
#
# Modify the variable below to enable/disable features.
#
# Can also be overridden at the command line, e.g.:
#
# make WITH_TLS=no
# =============================================================================

# Uncomment to compile the broker with tcpd/libwrap support.
#WITH_WRAP:=yes

# Comment out to disable SSL/TLS support in the broker and client.
# Disabling this will also mean that passwords must be stored in plain text. It
# is strongly recommended that you only disable WITH_TLS if you are not using
# password authentication at all.
WITH_TLS:=yes

# Comment out to disable TLS/PSK support in the broker and client. Requires
# WITH_TLS=yes.
# This must be disabled if using openssl < 1.0.
WITH_TLS_PSK:=yes

# Comment out to disable client threading support.
WITH_THREADING:=yes

# Comment out to remove bridge support from the broker. This allow the broker
# to connect to other brokers and subscribe/publish to topics. You probably
# want to leave this included unless you want to save a very small amount of
# memory size and CPU time.
WITH_BRIDGE:=yes

# Comment out to remove persistent database support from the broker. This
# allows the broker to store retained messages and durable subscriptions to a
# file periodically and on shutdown. This is usually desirable (and is
# suggested by the MQTT spec), but it can be disabled if required.
WITH_PERSISTENCE:=yes

# Comment out to remove memory tracking support from the broker. If disabled,
# mosquitto won't track heap memory usage nor export '$SYS/broker/heap/current
# size', but will use slightly less memory and CPU time.
WITH_MEMORY_TRACKING:=yes

# Uncomment to activate a consistency check on the usage of the memory tracking
# alloc/free function use. Any memory allocated without a tracking function,
# but freed with the tracking function will trigger an invalid memory read in
# memory trackers like valgrind memcheck or ASAN.
#ALLOC_MISMATCH_INVALID_READ:=yes

# Uncomment to activate consistency check on the usage of the memory tracking
# alloc/free function use. Any memory allocated without a tracking function,
# but freed with the tracking function will trigger an abort.
#ALLOC_MISMATCH_ABORT:=yes

# Compile with database upgrading support? If disabled, mosquitto won't
# automatically upgrade old database versions.
# Not currently supported.
#WITH_DB_UPGRADE:=yes

# Comment out to remove publishing of the $SYS topic hierarchy containing
# information about the broker state.
WITH_SYS_TREE:=yes

# Build with systemd support. If enabled, mosquitto will notify systemd after
# initialization. See README in service/systemd/ for more information.
# Setting to yes means the libsystemd-dev or similar package will need to be
# installed.
WITH_SYSTEMD:=no

# Build with SRV lookup support.
WITH_SRV:=no

# Build with websockets support on the broker.
# Set to yes to build with new websockets support
# Set to lws to build with old libwebsockets code
# Set to no to disable
WITH_WEBSOCKETS:=yes

# Build man page documentation by default.
WITH_DOCS:=yes

# Build with client support for SOCK5 proxy.
WITH_SOCKS:=yes

# Strip executables and shared libraries on install.
WITH_STRIP:=no

# Build static libraries
WITH_STATIC_LIBRARIES:=no

# Use this variable to add extra library dependencies when building the clients
# with the static libmosquitto library. This may be required on some systems
# where e.g. -lz or -latomic are needed for openssl.
CLIENT_STATIC_LDADD:=

# Build shared libraries
WITH_SHARED_LIBRARIES:=yes

# Build with async dns lookup support for bridges (temporary). Requires glibc.
#WITH_ADNS:=yes

# Build with epoll support.
WITH_EPOLL:=yes

# Build with bundled uthash.h
WITH_BUNDLED_DEPS:=yes

# Build with coverage options
WITH_COVERAGE:=no

# Build with unix domain socket support
WITH_UNIX_SOCKETS:=yes

# Build mosquitto with support for the $CONTROL topics.
WITH_CONTROL:=yes

# Build the broker with the jemalloc allocator
WITH_JEMALLOC:=no

# Build with xtreport capability. This is for debugging purposes and is
# probably of no particular interest to end users.
WITH_XTREPORT=no

# Use the old O(n) keepalive check routine, instead of the new O(1) keepalive
# check routine. See src/keepalive.c for notes on this.
WITH_OLD_KEEPALIVE=no

# Use link time optimisation - note that enabling this currently prevents
# broker plugins from working.
#WITH_LTO=yes

# Build with sqlite3 support - this enables the sqlite persistence plugin.
WITH_SQLITE=yes

# Use gmock for testing
WITH_GMOCK:=yes

# Build broker for fuzzing only - does not work as a normal broker. This is
# currently only suitable for use with oss-fuzz.
WITH_FUZZING=no

# Build using clang and with address sanitiser enabled
WITH_ASAN=no

# Build with editline support to allow the mosquitto_ctrl shell
WITH_EDITLINE=yes

# Build with basic HTTP API support
WITH_HTTP_API=yes
